## Buffer Overflow Vulnerability  

Attackers can exploit buffer overflow issues by overwriting the memory of an application. This changes the execution path of the program, triggering a response that damages files or exposes private information.  

The C program below may have a buffer overflow vulnerability:  

```c
#include <stdio.h>  
#include <string.h>  

int main() {  
    char buffer[10];  
    printf("Enter a string: ");  
    gets(buffer);  
    printf("You entered: %s\n", buffer);  
    return 0;  
}
```

### Question:
After you compile and run the program, which input below may cause the `"stack smashing detected"` error?  

- ○ `1234`  
- ○ `"teststring"`  
- ○ `"@$%^&*()"`  
- ○ `None of the above answer can cause the error.`
